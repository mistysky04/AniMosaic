# AniMosaic

## The future of anime tracking apps~

Imagine: A place to rate, track, and comment on your entire anime watching repertoire in one place!
**AniMosaic** is an application that allows users to add anime they've previously seen, are currently watching, or are 
planning to see in the future, in order to track the *mosaic* of shows they indulge in. The app will include
a variety of helpful features including:
- ranking show quality (0 - 5 stars)
- categorizing the show by genre
- adding total and current episode count
- write their own comments on inputted shows

AniMosaic will conveniently store all this information for the user, allowing them to continuously update its contents 
as their anime library grows. The app is perfect for avid anime watchers, as any fan knows how hard it is to keep track 
of all the seasonal releases and anticipated shows of the year, while also trying to remember which of the *700* 
episodes of Naruto they were on last time they watched.

As an avid anime watcher since 2013, I've been stuck using my notes app to track the watch-status of the 
many shows I've seen. I also loved adding small comments on each show, as its so much fun to refer back to my 13 year 
old thoughts. I'd love to be able to do this in a more organized and visually-pleasing way, making AniMosaic the perfect
project for me!
